# fitness-voice

AI voice-controlled trainer in your web browser, using NLP (wit.ai), body pose recognition and voice clone, with a privacy-based approach.

## Intro

🔒 We take privacy very seriously:

🔇 This web is controlled by voice BUT we only process your words online if you have first said the wake word "coach".

🔮 The wake-word "coach" (hotword) is detected offline thanks to Tensorflow libray.

👯 During exercises, we detect your body posture offline. Webcam images don't go to the Internet.

👩‍🎤 The coach's voices are not really famous people, they have been created with Artificial Intelligence.

👋 Hands-free web thanks to wit.ai, you don't need to press any buttons, just start talking.
